In November-December 2022 I conducted a pilot study utilizing several biodiversity monitoring tools and identified/mapped possible sampling locations for Earthshot's first biodiversity monitoring campaign at the Azuero Project in Panama, which will occur in March 2022. The primary goal was to get a feel for the landscape and determining the about of time and manpower needed for a full-scale biodiversity inventory.
