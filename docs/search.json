In March we\r\ncould replicate this study with more sampling locations and more\r\nreplicates per location in addition to baseline data for reforestation\r\nsites.\r\nSome points:\r\nVenao is a bit more inland and a bit higher elevation than\r\nAchotines, and I expect it gets more rain.\r\nI put “old growth” in quotation marks because I do not believe that\r\nthese forests are truly oldgrowth. I define old growth forest as a\r\nforest where the oldest growing species of tree has reached its natural\r\nlife expectancy, died of natural causes, and decomposed back into the\r\nsoil. Achotines has suspiciously no deadwood (another metric we could\r\nmeasure?), and the older sections of Venao are patchy, with a few large\r\nfallen trees but fewer than I’ve seen in ‘true’ old growth in\r\nSoberania.\r\nI only sampled secondary forest at Achotines - about 20 year old\r\nnatural regenration.\r\nThe teak plantation at Venao started as a mixed species planting, so\r\nthere is a lot more room between the trees and the ground has\r\nspikemosses (unlike the bare ground at the dense teak plantation near\r\nAchotines).\r\nThe silvopastoral at Achotines saw recent cow activity, while at\r\nVenoa has ongoing horse activity. The pasture at Achotines has already\r\nbeen planted by Pro Eco Azuero, and hasn’t had cows in about a year. The\r\npasture at Venao has frequent ongoing cow activity and cow patties\r\nreally close to subsampling locations.\r\nEach sample is a composite of three sub-samples collected 5m apart\r\nalong a N-S transect and homogenized in the field, in an attempt to\r\navoid micro-climate variability.\r\nI also collected litter samples and extracted invertebrates from\r\nthose, but did not have time to identify them (litter samples tend to\r\ntake longer)\r\nWith more data we will be able to run some ordination analyses and\r\ngain an understanding of community structure between land use\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere is a .csv file with raw data for the invert pilot study:\r\n\r\nDownload nov22_soil.csv\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst I cleaned up the data and prepared it for analysis, then\r\ncalculated diversity indexes:\r\nClick here for setup information.\r\n\r\n\r\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Hubert/Desktop/Earthshot/Nov 2022 markdown/Nov22_pilot\")\r\n\r\ndata <- read.csv(\"nov22_soil.csv\")\r\n\r\n#load packages\r\nlibrary(vegan)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n#library(\"dplyr\")\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(viridis)\r\nlibrary(gridExtra)\r\nlibrary('funrar')\r\n\r\n## Initial cleanup, organization\r\n\r\n#make dates recognizable by R\r\ndata$date<-as.Date(data$date, tryFormats = c(\"%Y-%m-%d\", \"%Y/%m/%d\"))\r\n                   \r\n\r\n#remove missing count values\r\ndata<-data[which(complete.cases(data$count)),]\r\n\r\n#create dataset with unknowns (for total abundance)\r\ndata.unknown<-data\r\n\r\n#create dataset without unknowns (for diversity and community composition)\r\ndata <- subset(data, !taxon == \"Unknown\",)\r\n\r\n#make my data wide for vegan package\r\nwide.data <- data %>%\r\n  spread(key=taxon,\r\n         value=count)\r\n\r\n#make same wide dataframes for data with unknowns\r\nwide.data.unknown <- data.unknown %>%\r\n  spread(key=taxon,\r\n         value=count)\r\n\r\n#Splitting data frame into count and environmental data\r\nwide.data2<-wide.data[,-c(1:12)]     \r\nwide.data3<-wide.data[,-c(13:65)]\r\nwide.data.unknown2<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(1:12)]\r\nwide.data.unknown3<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(13:66)]\r\n\r\n### during the real sampling we'll collect soil moisture values so that we can mass correct count data to dry mass.

Venao pasture actually has fairly high total\r\nabundance, possibly due to nutrient influxes from cow droppings.\r\nAbundance data is corrected for mass to give values of density per 1000g\r\ndry soil, though I didn’t actually measure moisture for the pilot and\r\nset a standard 40% across all samples for the calculations. Moisture has\r\na large influence on mass, and can vary considerably (30-50% in the wet\r\nseason in my experience), so this is a considerable source of error.\r\nStill better than using raw abundance data.\r\nTaxonomic Richness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder-level taxonomic richness shows a very clear progression in line\r\nwith successional state. Interestingly both intensive (Achotines) and\r\nspaced out (Venao) teak had the lowest richness. This is perhaps related\r\nto nutrient leaching and soil erosion (Fernández-Moya\r\net al 2014, Amponsah\r\n& Meyer 2008, Boley\r\net al 2009). Assessing biodiversity via richness has the caveat that\r\nrare species weigh pretty heavily on the metric. If a community has 100\r\nindividuals of one taxon but only one individual each for a further 9,\r\nthen it will have a higher richness than a community composed of 8\r\nsimilarly abundant taxa.\r\nShannon Diversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we’re starting to look at true diversity indexes that take into\r\naccount not only richness, but also evenness - the relative proportions\r\nof the taxa. Rare taxa don’t weigh as heavily on this value as they did\r\nfor richness. As expected the trends are not as clear. I have not run\r\nstatistical models to test for significance yet. Teak seems to have the\r\nlowest diversity on average, but pasture is not doing as poorly as one\r\nwould expect. Part of these differences are due to grassland and forest\r\nbeing different systems, with different species compositions, even if\r\nsimilar diversity (which may change with more data). This is why I want\r\nto look at community structure as well, though don’t think I have enough\r\ndata from just this pilot study.\r\nSimpson Diversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an oversimplification, the Simpson diversity index is even more\r\nheavily weighed away from rare taxa than Shannon. Results look similar\r\nto Shannon, but again, I didn’t run models to test for significance yet\r\n(nor would those models be able to say much with how little data I\r\ncollected).\r\nResponses of abundant taxa\r\nNow getting down into the weeds a little bit. While I haven’t done an\r\nordination analysis showing differences between communities, these\r\nfigures show how individual taxa respond to land use. All abundance is\r\nmass-corrected.I included two graphs for each taxon, one with absolute\r\nabundance, and one with relative abundance (showing something akin to\r\nevenness). For example, at the Achotines site the greatest absolute\r\nabundance of beetles (Coleoptera) occurred in “old-growth” soil, however\r\ntotal abundance was also greater in those soils so beetles were actually\r\nmore abundant relative to other taxa in pasture soil.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOf interest:\r\nCollembola and Oribatida (which are mostly fungivorous) were most\r\nabundant in “old-growth” and progressively less abundant in younger\r\nsuccession landscapes. This makes sense as you need more mature forest\r\nwith decent tree diversity to support mycorrhizal fungus diversity and\r\nprovide deadwood as substrate for other fungi.\r\nPsudoscorpiones, tiny arachnid predators of soil fauna appear to be\r\nvery sensitive to land use - they need forest. In my past research I\r\nfound that they were very sensitive to soil warming. Interestingly\r\nprotura, which were also very sensitive to warming, are less affected by\r\nland use in this pilot.\r\nHymenoptera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColeoptera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHemiptera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollembola\r\n\r\n\r\nNULL\r\n\r\nOribatida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Acari\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudoscorpiones\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplopoda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSymphyla\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
