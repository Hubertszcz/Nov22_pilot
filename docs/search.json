You will be seen and heard long before you could\r\nbe aware of them, and many only move around at night. Camera traps are a\r\ngreat tool for gaining an understanding of this hidden diversity. Camera\r\ntraps are essentially waterproof cameras that automatically take photos\r\nwhen something moves into the field of view, day and night. They can be\r\nleft with no maintenance to collect photos without disturbing wildlife\r\nfor months, depending on conditions and camera settings.\r\nThree camera traps set up on the same\r\ntree to test sensitivity\r\n \r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to get an understanding of the richness of\r\nmammal species, and to be able to say something about abundance and\r\ndensity of animal populations in a given area, is a grid of many cameras\r\ndeployed for at least a month. Arranging cameras in a grid as opposed to\r\neasy to reach places or at targeted sites where animals are more densely\r\nconcentrated is it allows objective comparison between projects and\r\nthrough time, and gives data on more variables than simply richness via\r\nthis ‘Random Encounter Model’.\r\nEco Venao\r\nAs a part of the November 2022 Pilot Study at the Azuero Project I\r\nwas testing three different models of camera trap, four different\r\nbattery types, two different security measures, and the difficulty of\r\nnavigating the terrain to get to pre-defined GPS points of a camera\r\ngrid. The first test involved setting up 8 cameras at Eco Venao. This\r\narea was chosen because it is easy to access, has trails, has forest\r\n(including a section of 80+ year old forest), and is among the best\r\nsites of the Azuero Project in terms of biodiversity, based on a quick\r\nsubjective assessment.\r\nMap of Eco Venao with camera\r\npointsMost days I had fieldwork at Venao I saw Howler monkeys, and every\r\nday I could hear them call in the distance at least once. At one point I\r\nsaw a family of Coatis, and even the print of a small cat (maybe a\r\njagarundi?). The forest was obviously not as rich as Soberania National\r\nPark near Gamboa, where I have done most of my Panamanian fieldwork int\r\nhe past, however I was optimistic that the cameras would pick up\r\nsomething cool.\r\nAfter 11 nights out in the field the only animals that the camera\r\npicked up other than horses released for grazing and a couple of humans\r\nwere a bird and a deer.\r\nCan you spot them in the photos?:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA disappointing result.\r\nHint on finding the deer: look at the very right edge. Yes, this is\r\nthe best photo I got of him.\r\nGamboa (Pipeline Road)\r\nTo confirm that the camera traps and techniques for affixing them to\r\ntrees work, I decided to test out the cameras off of Pipeline Road in\r\nSoberania National Park, near Gamboa.\r\nI did not have time to set cameras out on a truly random grid, but to\r\nprovide a sense of random distribution I positioned cameras 200 meters\r\napart, 20 meters from the road along the beginning of Pipeline Road.\r\nMap of Pipeline Road with camera\r\npointsWhile setting the cameras I knew that these would be more fruitful.\r\nFor one, a couple of the locations were near fruiting palms and figs,\r\nwhich attract many animals. Others fell near animal trails of one kind\r\nor another, and there were tracks virtually everywhere.\r\nPipeline RoadWhen I collected the cameras, after only four nights out, the results\r\nwere striking. Every camera picked up an abundance of animals. Agoutis\r\nwere the most abundant, as was expected - they’re even common in Gamboa\r\ntown. Other smaller animals including coati and armadillo were present,\r\nthough there were a number of larger animals that are targeted buy\r\nhunters as well. I was surprised by the number of peccary and deer the\r\ncamera traps caught so close to the road and near the edge of the\r\nforest. The highlight from the traps however was an ocelot, a clear sign\r\nof a healthy lowland neotropical forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis great diversity gives a glimpse of what the Azuero Peninsula\r\ncould look like after Earthshot restores the landscape.\r\nThe forest where I set my cameras is ~80 year old natural\r\nregeneration. There is still poaching pressure here, though it tends to\r\nbe restricted to the difficult to access depths of the park where there\r\nis no one to enforce protection. Perhaps more importantly it is\r\nconnected to old growth areas and is quite large and contiguous, part of\r\nthe green belt on either side of the Panama Canal. When Earthshot\r\nconnects Cerro Hoya to the rest of the Azuero Peninsula via the spider\r\nmonkey corridor perhaps we can see such diversity return. It will be a\r\ngradual process, giving animals space to exist and humans opportunities\r\nthat discourage poaching, though I expect we should see diversity\r\nbuilding even before that level of connectivity is reached.\r\nThe heart of the Spider Monkey\r\nCorridorGalindo Morales Land\r\nAnother important test I ran during the November 2022 Pilot Study was\r\nhow much effort it would require to place the required number of cameras\r\nacross a reforestation landscape. Eco Venao is a small area, already\r\nmostly forested, in the lowlands, and easy to access, so it is not\r\nrepresentative of the majority of land Earthshot will restore. Experts\r\nat Pro Eco Azuero said that the land of Galindo Morales is a top\r\npriority for planting next year, and representative of the lands\r\nEarthshot will restore. It is composed of several relatively large (100+\r\nha) land parcels at around 300 m elevation. Very hilly landscape\r\ncomposed of grassy cattle pasture interspersed with forested\r\ngullies.\r\nLooking across Galindo Morales’ land\r\n(from top left corner as seen on the map below)I created a grid of simulated camera coordinates on one of the land\r\nparcels and had a goal to just hike to as many as I could to get a feel\r\nfor the terrain and effort required for setting cameras. I had a full\r\nbackpack to stimulate carrying cameras, and carried a few metal stakes\r\nthat cameras would be attached to if there was no suitable tree near the\r\ncamera placement point.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that I couldn’t drive all the way to the entrance due to a\r\nvery muddy road (this won’t be an issue in the dry season, though good\r\nto know for the wet season sampling next July), and the terrain was very\r\ndifficult to traverse, especially steep gullies that do not register on\r\ntopographic maps. In 6 hours of bushwhacking I placed 10 cameras. Those\r\nnumbers could potentially have been boosted if local people (ranch\r\nhands, fence builders, ect.) who know the land help navigate.\r\nSome sights on the Morales plot:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To put things in\r\nperspective: There are three species of monkeys on the Azuero Peninsula.\r\nAll three belong to the same order: Primates. Cows, pigs, sheep, and\r\ngoats are also part of the same single order (Artiodactyla). A single\r\nsoil sample from a mature forest can contain more than twenty different\r\norders of animals. Most soil organisms in Panama are\r\nundescribed species - if you look at a sample under the microscope you\r\nare likely to be the first human to ever lay eyes on at least a few\r\nspecies. These tiny creature also play a critical role in the carbon\r\ncycle, contributing to decomposition of plant material and cycling\r\nnutrients in the soil.\r\nThe study\r\nI tested soil from have five different land use types (“old growth”,\r\nsecondary forest, silvopasture, pasture, and teak plantation) at two\r\nsampling locations (Eco Venao and Achotines/Vernes Land). In March we\r\ncould replicate this study with more sampling locations and more\r\nreplicates per location in addition to the baseline data for\r\nreforestation sites. A study like this now will help predict the\r\nprojected biodiversity changes with different planting regimes.\r\nSome points:\r\nVenao is a bit more inland and a bit higher elevation than\r\nAchotines, and I expect it gets more rain. Both sites are lower\r\nelevation than the main reforestation plots.\r\nI put “old growth” in quotation marks because I do not believe that\r\nthese forests are truly old-growth. I define old growth forest as a\r\nforest where the oldest growing species of tree has reached its natural\r\nlife expectancy, died of natural causes, and decomposed back into the\r\nsoil. Achotines has suspiciously no deadwood (another metric we could\r\nmeasure?), and the older sections of Venao are patchy, with a few large\r\nfallen trees but fewer than I’ve seen in ‘true’ old growth in\r\nSoberania.\r\nI only sampled secondary forest at Achotines - about 20 year old\r\nnatural regeneration.\r\nThe teak plantation at Venao started as a mixed species planting, so\r\nthere is a lot more room between the trees and the ground has\r\nspikemosses (unlike the bare ground at the dense teak plantation near\r\nAchotines).\r\nThe silvopastoral land at Achotines saw recent cow activity, while\r\nat Venao it has ongoing horse activity. The pasture at Achotines has\r\nalready been planted by Pro Eco Azuero, and hasn’t had cows in about a\r\nyear. The pasture at Venao has frequent ongoing cow activity and cow\r\npatties really close to subsampling locations.\r\nEach sample is a composite of three sub-samples collected 5m apart\r\nalong a N-S transect and homogenized in the field, in an attempt to\r\nlimit micro-climate effects.\r\nWith more data we will be able to run some ordination analyses and\r\ngain an understanding of community structure between land use\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere is a .csv file with raw data for the invert pilot study:\r\n\r\nDownload nov22_soil.csv\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst I cleaned up the data and prepared it for analysis, then\r\ncalculated diversity indexes:\r\nClick here for setup information.\r\n\r\n\r\nsetwd(\"C:/Users/Hubert/Desktop/Earthshot/Nov 2022 markdown/Nov22_pilot\")\r\n\r\ndata <- read.csv(\"nov22_soil.csv\")\r\n\r\n#load packages\r\nlibrary(vegan)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n#library(\"dplyr\")\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(viridis)\r\nlibrary(gridExtra)\r\nlibrary('funrar')\r\n\r\n## Initial cleanup, organization\r\n\r\n#make dates recognizable by R\r\ndata$date<-as.Date(data$date, tryFormats = c(\"%Y-%m-%d\", \"%Y/%m/%d\"))\r\n                   \r\n\r\n#remove missing count values\r\ndata<-data[which(complete.cases(data$count)),]\r\n\r\n#create dataset with unknowns (for total abundance)\r\ndata.unknown<-data\r\n\r\n#create dataset without unknowns (for diversity and community composition)\r\ndata <- subset(data, !taxon == \"Unknown\",)\r\n\r\n#make my data wide for vegan package\r\nwide.data <- data %>%\r\n  spread(key=taxon,\r\n         value=count)\r\n\r\n#make same wide dataframes for data with unknowns\r\nwide.data.unknown <- data.unknown %>%\r\n  spread(key=taxon,\r\n         value=count)\r\n\r\n#Splitting data frame into count and environmental data\r\nwide.data2<-wide.data[,-c(1:12)]     \r\nwide.data3<-wide.data[,-c(13:65)]\r\nwide.data.unknown2<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(1:12)]\r\nwide.data.unknown3<-wide.data.unknown[,-c(13:66)]\r\n\r\n### during the real sampling we'll collect soil moisture values so that we can mass correct count data to dry mass.

Venao pasture actually has fairly high total\r\nabundance, possibly due to nutrient influxes from cow droppings.\r\nAbundance data is corrected for mass to give values of density per 1000g\r\ndry soil, though I didn’t actually measure moisture for the pilot and\r\nset a standard 40% across all samples for the calculations. Moisture has\r\na large influence on mass, and can vary considerably (30-50% in the wet\r\nseason in my experience), so this is a considerable source of error.\r\nStill better than using raw abundance data.\r\nTaxonomic Richness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder-level taxonomic richness shows a very clear progression in line\r\nwith successional state. Interestingly both intensive (Achotines) and\r\nspaced out (Venao) teak had the lowest richness. This is perhaps related\r\nto nutrient leaching and soil erosion (Fernández-Moya\r\net al 2014, Amponsah\r\n& Meyer 2008, Boley\r\net al 2009). Assessing biodiversity via richness has the caveat that\r\nrare species weigh pretty heavily on the metric. If a community has 100\r\nindividuals of one taxon but only one individual each for a further 9,\r\nthen it will have a higher richness than a community composed of 8\r\nsimilarly abundant taxa.\r\nShannon Diversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we’re starting to look at true diversity indexes that take into\r\naccount not only richness, but also evenness - the relative proportions\r\nof the taxa. Rare taxa don’t weigh as heavily on this value as they did\r\nfor richness. As expected the trends are not as clear. I have not run\r\nstatistical models to test for significance yet. Teak seems to have the\r\nlowest diversity on average, but pasture is not doing as poorly as one\r\nwould expect. Part of these differences are due to grassland and forest\r\nbeing different systems, with different species compositions, even if\r\nsimilar diversity (which may change with more data). This is why I want\r\nto look at community structure as well, though don’t think I have enough\r\ndata from just this pilot study.\r\nSimpson Diversity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an oversimplification, the Simpson diversity index is even more\r\nheavily weighed away from rare taxa than Shannon. Results look similar\r\nto Shannon, but again, I didn’t run models to test for significance yet\r\n(nor would those models be able to say much with how little data I\r\ncollected).\r\nResponses of abundant taxa\r\nNow getting down into the weeds a little bit. While I haven’t done an\r\nordination analysis showing differences between communities, these\r\nfigures show how individual taxa respond to land use. All abundance is\r\nmass-corrected.I included two graphs for each taxon, one with absolute\r\nabundance, and one with relative abundance (showing something akin to\r\nevenness). For example, at the Achotines site the greatest absolute\r\nabundance of beetles (Coleoptera) occurred in “old-growth” soil, however\r\ntotal abundance was also greater in those soils so beetles were actually\r\nmore abundant relative to other taxa in pasture soil.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOf interest:\r\nCollembola and Oribatida (which are mostly fungivorous) were most\r\nabundant in “old-growth” and progressively less abundant in younger\r\nsuccession landscapes. This makes sense as you need more mature forest\r\nwith decent tree diversity to support mycorrhizal fungus diversity and\r\nprovide deadwood as substrate for other fungi.\r\nPsudoscorpiones, tiny arachnid predators of soil fauna appear to be\r\nvery sensitive to land use - they need forest. In my past research I\r\nfound that they were very sensitive to soil warming. Interestingly\r\nprotura, which were also very sensitive to warming, are less affected by\r\nland use in this pilot.\r\nHymenoptera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColeoptera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHemiptera\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProtura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollembola\r\n\r\n\r\nNULL\r\n\r\nOribatida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Acari\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPseudoscorpiones\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplopoda\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSymphyla\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
